HyperList is a methodology to describe anything in plain text.

It can be used as an outliner, a project or process tool, a logic breakdown tool, a mind map or for any number of different usages. Your imagination is (almost) the only limit.

HyperList can be used to describe any state or transition - anything from simple shopping and todo lists to large project plans, process design, the human history, the human DNA or the whole universe.

With HyperList, descriptions become simple, easily readable, concise and precise. 

This VIM plugin makes it easy to create and manage HyperLists using VIM.

The plugin includes a large range of features such as:

* Complete highlighting of HyperList elements
* Collapsing and expanding of up to 15 levels in a list
* Linking/referencing between elements (items) in a list
* Easy navigation in lists, including jumping to references
* "Presentation modes" where you can view only parts of lists and line-by-line
* Automatic underlining of State or Transition items in a list
* Creating and checking of checkboxes in a list, with or without date stamps
* Easy navigation to elements that needs filling out (when you use a list as a template)
* Encryption (and decryption) of whole lists or parts of lists
* Auto-encryption of lists - making a list into an excellent password safe
* HTML export of lists
*â€¯LaTeX export of lists
* Description on how to include HyperLists within other filetypes, thus taking full advantage of the above features when including a HyperList in e.g. a normal .txt document.
* All documents with the file suffix ".hl" is treated as HyperList documents
* ... and there are many more features. Check out the comprehensive documentation (type ":help HyperList" in VIM after install)

This VIM plugin is the continuation of the now deprecated WOIM plugin (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2518)
